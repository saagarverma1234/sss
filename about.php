		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>My name is Shaughn O’Donoghue, I am the director of Sunshine Specialist Supports and I’ve lived on the Sunshine Coast for 20 years.  I have worked in the disability sector for almost 30 years and am passionate about guiding people to get the most out of their life.  During this time, I’ve helped people with all abilities achieve incredible goals.</p>
		<h3>My values:</h3>
		<p>The core of my values is to listen first.  I want to hear your story, your dreams, visions and goals; what has worked for you before, and what experiences do you want to avoid.<br><br>

		Then I employ Person Centred Planning – using modern technology, strengths based approach, capacity and resilience building and providing guidance / advice before intervention.  I am resilient and persistent – I won’t give up on you and I will ensure that once you’ve reached your goals, you continue to achieve these outcomes, and where possible look at how we can raise the bar.<br><br>

		I am mindful that not all things go to plan.  I have the insight and experience to know when there is a need to re-evaluate and change direction, and have helped many people who have overcome incredible hurdles after looking at problem from a new perspective.<br><br>
		 
		My aim is to support others to be the best they can, and to overcome obstacles and barriers to find their path to success; and to build an inclusive business that celebrates all individual’s unique qualities and in doing so contribute to the diversity and richness of our community.</p>
		<h3>My skills:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Collaborating with others to identify solutions to problems</li>
				<li>providing clear written and oral communication</li>
				<li>providing advice and coaching to facilitate problem-solving strategies</li>
				<li>coaching others to initiate, structure and carry out steps to complete complex projects and tasks</li>
				<li>assisting individuals and groups achieve their personal and professional goals</li>
				<li>creating a positive environment in which to facilitate the successful resolution of disputes for individuals, groups and teams.</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>My experience:</h3>
		I have worked for 18 years with Disability Services as a Supports Facilitator (Service Advisor), Team Leader and Manager, as well as in various project and governance roles.  Prior to working for the Queensland Government, I worked for a number of disability service providers before opening my own business as a community arts worker who coordinated large scale, inclusive and accessible community events and ran music workshops and performances for people with a disability.<br><br>

		As a Supports Facilitator I worked with people to identify solutions that met their support needs by linking them to informal supports and recreational activities within their community that reduce the need for formal supports.  <br><br>

		I have linked hundreds of individuals to vocational and skill-development programs, domestic support and personal care providers.<br><br>

		As Team Leader, I regularly referred clients to therapists for case management and therapeutic interventions; produced written reports, person centred and positive behaviour support plans, and lead the intake and assessment team in the busiest service centre in the state.<br><br>

		I have worked hands-on with many complex cases from:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>individuals and families who struggled to navigate the disability service sector</li>
			<li>people with high and complex support needs</li>
			<li>people experiencing homelessness, the sudden breakdown of their supports or other crises</li>
			<li>young people in the care of the state</li>
			<li>people with positive behaviour support plans</li>
			<li>people (including young people) who had contact with the criminal justice system</li>
			<li>assisting in the preparation of reports to the mental health tribunal, QCAT and other court reports.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I understand the complexities of working with people who have a substitute decision maker, and I have vast experience working with multiple stakeholders in complex environments.<br><br>

		Using a strengths-based approach I focus on providing participants the opportunity to build their capacity to have the greatest level of involvement in exercising choice and control of their NDIS plan. I let my clients and their loved ones guide me on the level of involvement they want from me. <br><br>
		 
		I am aware of the changes and challenges the NDIA presents to participants and service providers:  the NDIA is a new system with new rules and is more participant-directed.<br><br>

		Please do not hesitate to call me if you have any questions.<br><br>
